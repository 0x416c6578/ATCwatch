#### You can support my work via paypal: https://paypal.me/hoverboard1 this keeps projects like this comming.

Use this portable Arduino version: https://atcnetz.de/downloads/D6Arduino.rar
here is a manual on how to use it: https://youtu.be/3gjmEdEDJ5A
Unzip, open Arduino.exe open the ATCwatch.ino file and compile. Done
Simply select the DaFit as the board and click on compile, you will get an Update file you can flash in the Arduino folder.

Please make shure you have always an option to go back to Bootlaoder somehow, i can only suggest to have one watch opened and connected an SWD St-Link V2 to it to develope on that.


#### This can be flashed without opening the Watch with this Repo https://github.com/atc1441/DaFlasherFiles and the DaFlasher app from the PlayStore(Android):
